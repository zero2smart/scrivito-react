## Features

Scrivito is a SaaS Content Management Service, built for digital agencies and medium to large sized businesses.

It is the only CMS that combines unmatched WYSIWYG usability for editors with maximum flexibility for developers â€“ because it is at the forefront of the current [JavaScript web development revolution](https://www.webdevelopmentrevolution.com/).

And because Scrivito is 100% serverless, you'll never have to patch your CMS, so it's the most secure and cost-effective solution on the market.

## Getting Started

### Install/check prerequisites
Make sure that you have [![node â‰¥ 8.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/node-â‰¥%208.0-blue.svg)](https://nodejs.org) and [![npm â‰¥ 5.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-â‰¥%205.0-blue.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed.

```
node -v
# should output something like v8.9.4

npm -v
# should output something like 5.6.0
```

### Install dependencies

Now simply call `npm install` in the command line to install all JS dependencies (which are placed in the folder `node_modules/`).

### How to develop

Calling `npm start` will start a webserver, which listens to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) and opens this URL in your browser. It should also automatically reload the page after changes to the code (in `src/`) have been made.

## Your first change

To see development in action, let's change the `ButtonWidget` so that it prefixes all buttons with your favorite emoji.

Open up the react component responsible for rendering a `ButtonWidget`. It's located at `src/Widgets/ButtonWidget/ButtonWidgetComponent.js`. Now look for the `Scrivito.LinkTag` and insert

```jsx
{ 'ðŸš€ ' }
```

before

```jsx
{ text }<i className="fa fa-angle-right fa-4" aria-hidden="true" />
```

After saving the file, your browser should automatically reload [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your new emoji button. Of course you can choose another emoji, check out [emojipedia.org](https://emojipedia.org).

Have fun!

## How to build/compile

Calling `npm run build` will compile all JS, HTML and CSS and place it in the `build/` folder. It also creates a `build.zip` file, which can be deployed via [my.scrivito.com](https://my.scrivito.com).
